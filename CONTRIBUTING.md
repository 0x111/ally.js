# ally.js Contribution Guide

* ally.js is a tool for modern browsers (IE10 and newer), if you need to support anything older than that, feel free to submit PRs.
* ally.js is authored in ES6 ("ES.next", "ES2015", â€¦) (specifically make use of the ES6 Module Syntax) while still providing maximum convenience when it comes to consuming the library (compiled UMD bundle, AMD modules, CommonJS modules, ES6 modules).
* To stay lean, we don't want to add external dependencies unless we absolutely have to.
* To stay out of the "too many tools" debate, build infrastructure has to work via npm (configured via `package.json`).

## Compiling ally.js

```sh
# build everything
npm run build
# remove everything in dist
npm run clean
```

### Compiling ally.js to a single UMD bundle

ally.js is made available in one convenient file, consumable as a browser global (`window.ally`), via AMD and CommonJS (exposed in UMD). The source is compiled to the distributable by [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) using [babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify) to resolve the ES6 modules.

```sh
# build the UMD bundle
npm run build-umd
# remove everything in dist
npm run clean
```

Stop that `npm run` bollocks, gimme real CLI:

```sh
# build the UMD bundle
node_modules/.bin/browserify \
  src/ally.js \
  --debug \
  --standalone ally \
  --transform babelify \
  | exorcist dist/ally.js.map > dist/ally.js
# minify the UMD bundle
node_modules/.bin/uglifyjs \
  dist/ally.js \
  --in-source-map dist/ally.js.map \
  --source-map dist/ally.min.js.map \
  --preamble '/*! ally.js */' \
  --screw-ie8 \
  --mangle \
  --compress \
  --output dist/ally.min.js
# remove everything in dist
rm -rf dist/*
```

### Converting to AMD and CommonJS

To allow developers to use selected features (rather than import everything), the ES6 source (`src`) is made available in ES5 via AMD and CommonJS in `dist/amd` and `dist/common`.

```sh
# convert to CommonJS modules
npm run build-common
# convert to AMD modules
npm run build-amd
# keep converting to dist/amd while working on src
npm run watch-amd
```

Stop that `npm run` bollocks, gimme real CLI:

```sh
# convert to CommonJS modules
node_modules/.bin/babel \
  --source-maps \
  --modules common \
  --out-dir dist/common \
  src
# convert to AMD modules
node_modules/.bin/babel \
  --source-maps \
  --modules amd \
  --out-dir dist/amd \
  src
# keep converting to dist/amd while working on src
node_modules/.bin/babel \
  --watch \
  --source-maps \
  --modules amd \
  --out-dir dist/amd \
  src
```

See the [Babel CLI docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/)

## Linting

Since ally.js is using the ES6 Module Syntax - and [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) does not support that yet - we're using [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) as the parser in eslint (configured via `.eslintrc`). See the docs to understand the [rules](http://eslint.org/docs/rules).

While code style is validated using eslint, code format is verified using [jscs](http://jscs.info/overview.html) (configured via `.jscsrc`).

**Note:** Although listed in the devDependencies of package.json and thus installed locally, babel-eslint has to be installed globally (for now?):

```sh
npm install -g babel-eslint
```

### Usage

```sh
npm run lint
```

Stop that `npm run` bollocks, gimme real CLI:

```sh
node_modules/.bin/eslint src/**/*.js
node_modules/.bin/jscs src
```

Linting is done automatically via git hooks by way of [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky).

## ES6 in older browsers

Currently only a single ES6 function (Array.prototype.findIndex) is used in ally.js. Should we choose to use more ES6 functions, possibly things like `Set` and `Map`, we would have to include the [babel polyfill](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) in our distribution

```js
npm install babel-core
cat node_modules/babel-core/browser-polyfill.js dist/ally.js > dist/ally.old-browser.js
```

## External Dependencies

The ally.js not only contains the library but also a lot of browser capability tests in the `tests` directory and the website in the `gh-pages` branch. To make all that stuff run a couple of dependencies have to be made available, that are *not* required to run the core library itself, but since don't have custom `dependencies` namespaces available in npm, the following packages are referenced as `devDependencies` as well:

* [requirejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/requirejs)
* [underscore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/underscore)
* [sequence-comparison-table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequence-comparison-table)
* [jquery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery)
* [jquery-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery) wtf? `"jquery-ui": "https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui.git#1.11.4",` possibly `https://github.com/components/jqueryui`
* [platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/platform)
