# ally.js Contribution Guide

* ally.js is a tool for modern browsers (IE10 and newer), if you need to support anything older than that, feel free to submit PRs.
* ally.js is authored in ES6 ("ES.next", "ES2015", â€¦) (specifically make use of the ES6 Module Syntax) while still providing maximum convenience when it comes to consuming the library (compiled UMD bundle, AMD modules, CommonJS modules, ES6 modules).
* To stay lean, we don't want to add external dependencies unless we absolutely have to.
* To stay out of the "too many tools" debate, build infrastructure has to work via npm (configured via `package.json`).
