# Frequently Asked Questions

There are a couple of questions we have been asked over and over again…


## "ally" Not "a11y"?

When the project started in October 2014, it was called "a11y.js". We didn't register any domains or grabbed the npm package name - which turned out to be a problem a couple of weeks later. We're not sad this happened.

"ally" ([phonetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) `ælaj`) is easier to pronounce than "a11y" (phonetic `ə əlɛvən waj`). "a11y" is a [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) and expands to "accessibility". "ally" has a number of [definitions](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ally) ranging from "friend" to "cooperating", which has a much nicer tone to it.


## Why Was This Created?

While trying to learn accessbility in general and keyboard navigation in particular, it became obvious that the web was not making things easy. Tutorials were missing important pieces - Coherence and a focus on the developer usually wasn't a thing. Examples looked like their JavaScript was written in the 90s, or depended on jQuery, or left out important pieces.

We weren't able to use any of the existing solutions. We also weren't going to just copy paste other people's code into our applications and let the cycle repeat. We wanted to create the basis for accessibility experts and web developers to *collaborate* in a way that might help everyone.


## Ultimate Goal?

In theory the ultimate goal for ally.js is to make itself obsolete because web standards and browser implementations have caught up. This isn't very likely to happen any time soon, if at all. In the meanwhile the goal is to provide all the low-level utilities required for other libraries and websites and applications to make accessible experiences an easier target.


## Where Was This Created?

Initial efforts were spurred by the [Smart Home platforms](https://www.qivicon.com/en/) of Deutsche Telekom. While Deutsche Telekom is not an official sponsor of this project, it has to be noted that they paid for some of the early development.


## Corporate Backing?

As of today ally.js does not receive official funding or guidance from anyone. We'd be happy to hand over stewardship to a web-standards-involved organization that understands OSS and the community.
