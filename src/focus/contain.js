  /*
      Contain focus within a given element, wrapping focus to first/last element when boundaries are hit.
      This is useful when making sure that you cannot escape a modal dialog.

      focusContain(context) returns a function to disengage containing the focus.
      This function is also exposed on context._unregisterContainFocusHandler;

      Having multiple (nested) contexts containing the focus is technically possible.

      Note: It is, unlike the native <dialog> implementation in Blink,
      not possible to tab to the browser chrome while focusContain() is active.
